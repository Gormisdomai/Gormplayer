# Gormplayer
A quick and dirty way for me and my friends to play music in our lounge

Usage
-----

Edit the ip adresses in client.html and gormplayer.html

Run the python script Serve.py

Host the webpage on your local wifi
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
(in the main directory)


Open gormplayer.html on the computer with the best speakers.
Anyone can now open client.html and paste youtube links in to play them.

Bonus! People in other rooms can also run gormplayer.html and tune into lounge fm
